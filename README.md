   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GAGANTAK/flutter-calculator-for-bhm.git
   cd flutter-calculator-for-bhm
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
alter you can see my flutter running calculator through link: (https://1drv.ms/v/c/9279aa2644ff33fd/Ea883juXPuBPh6I5B2n5v_MBPWu1YDryTccHKI5HPOj97g?e=fPZhw1)
enter this into cmd to get the code run into your pc if any error occured try downlaoding this files and open a new folder the open the folder in android studio and get the all file running by checking the main.dart code 
How this is build ?
created the basic logic in python converted those logic into cpp and used basic flutter for completing the task then optimized the code with the help of chatgpt to get the final task completed 
Key features :
void button pressed or tapped contains the basic logics like declaring strings doubles and bools as like num 1 num2  as doubles and current clicked or current input and operand as operator ie + - / * and then used basic logic like defining base case as all as 0 or empty strings and bool ( for if else statement should our input cleared on next or not ) and then used if else statements and conversion of string to num and num to string by double.parse and to.string and getting the final output upon clicked 
now building button to evaluate the expressions elevated buttons into this colour padding shape elevation for shadow effect creating the top bar to show the calculator text gridview.builder for arrangement of our options or buttons.
you can thoroughly see the code for more details,  yet full code is not written by me.
adding of log function and exponentiol and trignometric and  there inverse can be done through this that a scientific calculator can do but first we have to understand the flutter to that level i had done this in less then 2 Days.
